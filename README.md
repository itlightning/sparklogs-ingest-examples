# SparkLogs Ingest Examples

[SparkLogs](https://sparklogs.com/) is a cloud-first log management platform that is limitless (petabyte-scale), easy (schemaless + auto-extract), affordable (ingest everything), and a joy to use (cross-platform modern UX).

This repository provides examples how to ingest log data into SparkLogs from various data sources and applications written in different languages.

## Examples

- [Node.Js with Winston](nodejs/sparklogs-winston-example/README.md)
- [Node.Js with Bunyan](nodejs/sparklogs-bunyan-example/README.md)

More examples will be added soon. Stay tuned!
